HistPresent
===========

This is a standalone version of the [*Histogram
Presenter*](https://www-old.mll-muenchen.de/marabou/htmldoc/hpr/index.html) for
ROOT from the MARaBOU package (https://www-old.mll-muenchen.de/marabou/htmldoc,
https://github.com/flueke/marabou).

The code was extracted from the MARaBOU sources, CMake build scripts have been
added and compile issues have been fixed (6/2023).

Update 4/2025: ported to ROOT-6.34. This removes all PROOF based features.
